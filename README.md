## Lensless microscope software

This application enables to perform measurements for a digital lensless holographic microscope in on-axis (Gabor) configuration. The developed software connects with the following devices:
+ camera - here, Allied Vision AV1800u2050, for holograms acquisition,
+ stepper motor - here, Thorlabs ZTS25A-Z8, drived by Thorlabs KDC101 or Thorlabs PIA25, driven by Thorlabs KIM101
